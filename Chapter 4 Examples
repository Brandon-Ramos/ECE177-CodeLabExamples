Q = Question     A = Answer     W = Why

Q   Given the char variable c, write an expression that is true if and only if the value of c is not the space character.
A   c != ' '
W   We are given the char variable c which we want to set not equal to the space character. This make it true for all values except for 
    when c is equal to the space character. The space character is a single character so it has to be in single quotation marks. 
    
    
Q   Write an expression that evaluates to true if and only if the integer variable workedOvertime is true.
A   workedOvertime                   //workedOvertime && 1  would also work
W   For this problem we can assume that the variiable workedOvertime has been assigned some non-zero number. This makes it so 
    workedOvertime always will evaluate to true. Also remember that 1 also represents true, so workedOvertime && (anded) with 1 will also
    evaluate to true.
    
    
Q   Given the variables temperature and humidity, write an expression that evaluates to true if and only if temperature is greater than 
    90 and humidity is less than 10.
A   (temperature > 90) && (humidity < 10)  //A single ampersand (&) also works. The parentheses aren't needed, good practice to use them. 
W   All we want to do is set the variable temperature to greater than 90 (temperature > 90) and we want to and it (&&) with the variable
    humiidity less than 10 (humidity < 10).
    
    
Q   Given the variables isFullTime and age, write an expression that evaluates to true is and only if age is less that 19 or isFullTime 
    is true. 
A   (age < 19) || (isFullTime && 1)     //(age < 19) || (isFullTime) will also work
W   The only new element here is the logiical or operator (||). We have to use the logical or operator and not the bitwise or operator (|)
    because we want both sides of the expression to be evaluated. The bitwise or operator (single |) will not evaluate the second argument
    if the first argument evaluated to true. The logical or operator (||) will evaluate both sides of the expression regardless. Similary,
    the logical and operator (&&) doesn't evaluate the second argument if the firs is false, bitwise does. 


Q   Write an expression that evaluates to true if the value of the interger variable Prizes is divisible (with no remainder) by the
    integer variable Participants.
A   Prizes % Participants == 0
W   So we want to divide our first variable Prizes by our second variable Participants. We want to use the remainder operator (%) because
    we want a remainer. The remainder we want is zero so divide the variable Prizes by the variable Participants evaluated to ture when 
    the remainder is zero. Use the doubles equals (==) because we do want to make Prizes % Participants equal to zero. 
    
    
Q   Write an expression that evaluates to true if the integer variable x contains an even value and false if it contains an odd value.
