Q = Question     A = Answer     W = Why

Q   Write a complete program that would print your last name, followed by a comma, followed by your first name. 
A   int main(){                 //main(){ would also work
      int Brandon;
      int Ramos;
    printf("Ramos,Brandon);
    }
W   Programs start in main and the text between the curly braces is compiled. After starting the program (int main(){), declare 2 variables
    for both the last and firs name which is to be compiled. To print something you have to use the printf function. What we are printing 
    is a last name, comma, and a first name in that order with no spaces. So within the printf function, enter what is being asked
    (printf("Ramos,Brandon")). The double quotation marks are needed because we are printing a string constant. Now just end the program 
    with a curly brace.
