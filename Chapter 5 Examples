Q = Question     A = Answer     W = Why

Q   Write a statement that calls printTodaysdate, it accepts no parameters and returns no value.
A   void printTodaysdate();   
W   This is a basic function call, it causes a functions statement to be executed.


Q   Write a statement calling the function printError, passing it the value 14.
A   printError(14);
W   What is in the parentheses is the parameter we are passing through the function. We could add multiple parameters by separating the
    values with commas.


Q   add is a function that accepts two int parameters and returns their sum. Two int variables, euroSales and asiaSales, have already
    been declared and initialized. Another int variable, eurasiaSales, has already been declared. Write a statement that calls add to 
    compute the sum of euroSales and asiaSales and store this value in eurasiaSales.
A   eurasiaSales = add(euroSales, asiaSales);
W   Notice what the function add does in the question. It accepts two int parameters that we pass through it and adds them together. So
    we want to call the add function and pass it the variasbles (parameters) euroSales and asiaSales, Finally, we want to store the sum
    in the variable eurasiaSales. So we set eurasiaSales equal to the function add with the two parameters being passed through it.
    
    
Q   max is a function that accepts two int parameters and returns the value of the larger one. Four int variables, population1, 
    population2, population3, and population4 have already been declared and initialized. Write an expression (not a statement!) whose 
    value is the largest of population1, population2, population3, and population4 by calling max. 
A   max(population1, max(population2, max(population3, population4)))
W   Operator precedence is everything here. The first function to be evaluated is the max(population3, population4) function. It will 
    take the larger of the two vaules and return it. Next max(population2, max) is evaluated. Notice that population2 is now being 
    evaluated against the new value of the function max. Now the final max(population1, max) expression is evaluated.


Q   Write the definition of a function printDottedLine, which has no parameters and doesn't return anything. The function prints to 
    standard output a single line (terminated by a new line character) consisting of 5 periods.
A   printDottedLine(){         //void printDottedLine(){ also works
        printf(".....\n");
    }
W   The definition of the function printDottedLine doesn't accept any parameters. To declare this simply call the function without 
    passing through it any parameters (printDottedLine(){). The next step is to print a single line of 5 periods terminated by a new 
    line (printf(".....\n");).
