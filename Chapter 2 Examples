Q. Write an interger representing the long interger value twelve million.
A. 12000000
Why. Writing an integer is the same as writing out a number. Note that this is an expression and not a statement so a semicolon should not 
    be used.


Q. Write a hexadecimal integer literal representing the value fifteen.
A. 0x0F
Why. This requires you to know how numbers in hex work. Numbers in hex go from 0-F (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F). The 
    letter 'A' corresponds to 10, 'B' to 11, 'C' to 12, 'D' to 13, 'E' to 14, 'F' to 15. Now the denomination for writing hex values is
    0x, this goes before the number in Hex you're writing. Now, for the example above, 0xF would also work but it's good practice to use
    0x0F. 


Q. Write a floating point literal corresponding to one and a half. 
A. 1.5
Why. Similiar to the first problem, we are writing out an integer. The floating point means that the integer can hold a decimal in the 
    number.
  
  
Q. Write out a character literal representing a comma.
A. ','
Why. The single quotation marks specifies a character literal. The single quotation marks work with and single character. 


Q. What literals represent false and true values respectively.
A. 0, 1
Why. 0 will always correspond to false and 1 will always correspond to true. 


Q. Write a character string literal representing the firs word in this sentence.
A. "Write"
Why. While single quotation marks are used to represent single characters, double quotation marks are use to represent strings. 


Q. Write a declaration for two integer variables, age and weight.
A. int age, weight;
Why. You can declare multiple variables of the same type on the same line by separating them with a comma.
