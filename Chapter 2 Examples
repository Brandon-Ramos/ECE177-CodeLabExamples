Q. Write an interger representing the long interger value twelve million
A. 12000000
Why. Writing an integer is the same as writing out a number. Note that this is an expression and not a statement so a semicolon should not 
be used.

Q. Write a hexadecimal integer literal representing the value fifteen
A. 0x0F
